# Abstract
This thesis examines the role of public funding on private investment in research
and development (R&D) and tries to answer if public funding can increase private
investment in R&D to foster innovation and progress.
This thesis includes a literature review of the existing evidence as well as an empirical analysis that is based on OECD data from 1981 to 2021. The main findings include that public funding can increase private investment but the relationship between them is non-linear. Moreover, the effectiveness seems to change depending
on the region and time period.
The findings highlight that policymakers must apply proper policy tools depending
on their own needs to maximize the benefits of public funding on private R&D investment and innovation.
